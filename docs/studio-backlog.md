# Studio improvement backlog

A living list of developer-experience improvements for TesseraQL Studio — what has
shipped and what remains — so the work can be picked up across sessions. Priorities
are indicative; revisit as the editor loop matures. See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for
the framework-wide plan and [hypermedia-ui.md](hypermedia-ui.md) for the blessed UI
patterns (mandatory rule 11: UI gaps belong upstream in Hypermedia Components).

## Shipped

Studio editor + docs work (2026-06):

- **Live validation, draft visibility, inline apply errors** (#106) — the editor
  validates as you type via `StudioService.preview()`, flags an unsaved draft with a
  compare/discard affordance, and surfaces `INVALID_DRAFT` inline.
- **Adopt hc 0.1.3 `hc-code`/`hc-sparkline`; retire app CSS** (#107) — the editor,
  source display, coverage gutter, and trend charts moved onto kit components; the
  `.source`/`.cov-line*`/`.spark*` rules were deleted from `tesseraql.css`.
- **Real unified diff in the compare panel** (#108) — an LCS line diff (saved source
  → draft) rendered with `hc-code data-mode="diff"`.
- **Server-tokenized SQL highlighting in the docs route view** (#109) — `SqlHighlighter`
  emits the hc 0.1.4 `hc-code__tok` contract; 2-way SQL directives/binds → `meta`.
- **Highlight the source view, diff panel & YAML/templates** (#110) — `YamlHighlighter`,
  `TemplateHighlighter`, and a `Highlighter` extension dispatcher; the read-only source
  view and the diff panel are highlighted by file type.
- **Rendered preview against sample data (A1, slices 1–2)** — a renderable file renders against
  a sample model rather than only validating against an empty one, and the editor shows the
  actual output two ways: the generated HTML/text/JSON, hc-code highlighted, and (for HTML) a
  sandboxed `iframe` visual preview styled with the hc stylesheet. Two shapes render:
  - a **template file** (`.html`/`.tpl`) against the sample as its template variables;
  - a **web route** (`web/**/<method>.yml`) against the sample as the execution context (`params`,
    `sql.rows`, …): `query-html`/`page` resolves `response.html.model` and renders the route's
    template, `query-json` resolves `response.json.body`, applies its `response.json.fields`
    output-field masking, and pretty-prints it.

  The sample is YAML/JSON typed in the editor, prefilled from a colocated `<name>.sample.yml`
  fixture (blank falls back to it). `StudioService.render`/`sampleModel`, the `studio.render`
  provider, the `POST /_tesseraql/studio/render` JSON endpoint, and the
  `/_tesseraql/studio/ui/render` editor fragment; the source page CSP gains `frame-src 'self'`.
- **Run a route's or job's declarative tests from Studio (A2)** — a **route or job** source page
  gains a **Run tests** action that runs the declarative test cases covering it against the dev
  datasource with inline pass/fail: `sql` queries **and writes** (an `INSERT … RETURNING` runs and
  is rolled back) and `validate` rules (their SQL runs against the sandbox) plus the pure (no DB)
  `notify` and `http-call` evaluations (the latter plans a job's outbound step without a network
  call). Gated and sandboxed: enabled only when Studio is writable and
  `tesseraql.studio.testRunner.enabled` is set; each case runs through a `SandboxDataSource` — an
  auto-rollback transaction (commits suppressed, rolled back on close) with a statement timeout and a
  row cap — so a case can neither run away nor persist a write. Contract cases run too, through a
  sandboxed identity service built over the same datasources, so their identity SELECTs are capped
  and rolled back like every other case. New
  `StudioTestService` reusing the declarative `TestRunner` +
  `CrossReferenceIndex`, the `studio.runTests` provider, the `POST /_tesseraql/studio/runTests` JSON
  endpoint, and the `/_tesseraql/studio/ui/run-tests` editor fragment.
- **Live data in the rendered preview (A1 "real bound params" × A2 sandbox)** — the route render
  panel gains a **Use live data** toggle (when the test runner is enabled): instead of a
  hand-authored `sql.rows` fixture, it runs the route's main `sql` query through the same
  `SandboxDataSource` (bind params resolved from the sample's `params`/`query`) and injects the real
  `rows`/`rowCount`, so editing a route previews the actual page/JSON over live dev data.
  `StudioService.RowSource` (a DB-free callback the runtime fills with `StudioTestService.liveRows`);
  `live` flows through the `studio.render` provider, `POST /_tesseraql/studio/render`, and the
  `/_tesseraql/studio/ui/render` fragment.
- **Scaffold CRUD from a table (B3, slices 1–2)** — a **scaffold** page (linked from the explorer
  chrome when enabled) lists the dev datasource's tables, introspected live with the same
  `CatalogIntrospector` the portal's schema view uses, and previews the CRUD slice the generator would
  produce for a chosen table — reusing the CLI's `TableIntrospector` + `CrudScaffolder` so the files
  are byte-identical to `scaffold crud`. Each generated file is shown highlighted with the apply
  disposition (`new`/`unchanged`/`regenerate`/`conflict`); **Create these files** then writes the
  slice via `ScaffoldWriter` (edit detection + optional `force`), reporting written/unchanged/skipped
  and which new routes need a restart to be served. Database-free `StudioService.scaffoldPreview`/
  `scaffoldApply`; runtime `StudioScaffoldService` owns the introspection. Gated on writable Studio +
  `tesseraql.studio.scaffold.enabled`. `studio.scaffold.tables`/`studio.scaffold.preview`/
  `studio.scaffold.apply` providers, `GET /scaffold/tables` + `POST /scaffold/preview` + `POST
  /scaffold/apply` endpoints, the `/_tesseraql/studio/ui/scaffold` page.
- **New route from the explorer (B3, slice 3)** — a **New route** form on the explorer (when
  writable) takes a `web/**/<method>.yml` path and a recipe and saves a parseable starter skeleton as
  a draft, then opens it in the source editor to finish, reusing the existing validate → apply flow.
  Database-free `StudioService.newRouteDraft`; the `studio.newRoute` provider and `/ui/new` route.
- **Explorer directory tree + filter (C4)** — the flat route/job tables became one directory tree
  folded from the source paths (nested `<details>` folders, each route/job a leaf linking to its
  source with a method/`job` badge), with a live filter box (case-insensitive over
  id/path/recipe/method/source) that prunes the tree, re-rendered server-side via htmx (`hx-get` +
  `hx-select`, no bespoke JS). Database-free `StudioService.explorer(query)`; the tree (a recursive
  `StudioViews` fold + a self-referencing Thymeleaf fragment); `GET /explorer?q=…` carries the query.
- **Concurrent-edit conflict detection (D5, slice 1)** — saving a draft records the source it is
  based on (a sidecar beside the draft); applying detects a source that changed underneath the draft
  and refuses to overwrite it (no last-apply-wins) unless forced — the editor shows a conflict warning
  and a review-gated overwrite checkbox, and `POST /apply` answers `409` without `force`. Database-free
  `StudioService.draftConflicts` + `applyDraft(path, force)`; `STUDIO-4090 → 409` in the error map.
- **Draft overview (D5, slice 2)** — a **drafts** page (linked from the explorer when writable) lists
  every pending draft under `work/studio/drafts` with a link to its editor, a new/edit kind, and a
  conflict badge. Database-free `StudioService.drafts()`; `studio.drafts` provider; `GET /drafts`.
- **Audit trail (D6, slice 1)** — every source-writing action (apply a draft, apply a scaffold) is
  stamped to an append-only `work/studio/audit/audit.jsonl` with who (`principal.loginId`) / what /
  target / when, recorded at the single write point in `StudioService` so no caller path bypasses it.
  An **audit** page (linked from the explorer when writable) lists it newest-first; applied paths link
  to their editor. `applyDraft(…, actor)` / `scaffoldApply(…, actor)` + `auditEntries(limit)`;
  `studio.audit` provider; `GET /audit`.
- **Per-role edit permission (D6, slice 2)** — `tesseraql.studio.editRoles` allow-list refines the
  writable master switch: when set, only a caller holding one of those roles may mutate; every
  mutating endpoint/UI action answers `403` for everyone else and the explorer/source render the
  read-only view. Per-caller from `principal.roles` via the runtime `StudioAccess` gate (the mutating
  routes bind `roles: principal.roles`); `STUDIO-4031 → 403`.

Upstream Hypermedia Components briefs filed and adopted: `hc-code` (read-only block,
gutter, diff), editable `hc-code`, `hc-sparkline`, and read-only syntax highlighting
(issues #253–256, #261). The editable live-highlight overlay (hc issue #264) **shipped in hc 0.1.5**
and is being adopted (see E below).

## Remaining (prioritized)

### A. Tighten the edit → verify loop (highest value, extends what shipped)

1. **Rendered preview against sample/real data** — ✅ **done** (see Shipped): template files and
   **web routes** (`query-html`/`page` → `response.html.model` + template; `query-json` →
   `response.json.body`) render against a fixture and show HTML/text/JSON output plus a sandboxed
   visual `iframe` for HTML — the "Studio as the center of the edit loop" gate (decision point 4) is
   met. Optional follow-ups, not blockers (pick up opportunistically):
   - **PDF preview** — *done*: a `query-export` `format: pdf` route renders an actual PDF in the
     preview panel — its print template is converted to PDF from the sample's `sql.rows` and shown in
     an `<iframe>` (`data:` URL) with a download link. Reuses the canonical PDF codec; Studio stays
     free of the heavy optional `tesseraql-pdf` stack via a `StudioService.PdfRender` callback the
     runtime fills (degrades to a clear message when the module is absent). Source/render CSP gains
     `data:` in `frame-src`.
   - **Output-field masking** — *done*: the JSON preview applies a `query-json` route's
     `response.json.fields` masking (hide/redact per policy/classification/mask), reusing the canonical
     `FieldPolicyApplier` evaluated for the sample principal the developer puts under `principal` in the
     render sample. Studio stays free of the security/compiler stack — the runtime supplies the mask via
     a `StudioService.FieldMask` callback (the A1 live-rows `RowSource` pattern).

   With output-field masking and PDF preview both shipped, A1 is fully complete (template files, web
   routes, live data, JSON field-masking, and PDF export preview).

   The "render against **real** bound params" end — executing the route's SQL through the A2
   sandbox to populate live rows instead of a hand-authored `sql.rows` fixture — is **done** (the
   render panel's **Use live data** toggle; see Shipped). (Email/notification `.html` templates
   already preview via the template-file path: supply `payload`/`event` as the sample.)
2. **Run a route's or job's declarative suite from Studio** — *done* (see Shipped): a **Run tests**
   action runs every declarative case kind covering a route or job — `sql` (read **and write**),
   `validate`, `contract` (through a sandboxed identity service), `notify`, and `http-call` — against
   the dev datasource, sandboxed (auto-rollback) and opt-in.
   - **Live rows into the rendered preview** — *done* (see Shipped): the route render panel's **Use
     live data** toggle runs the route's main `sql` through the sandbox for real rows. Multi-binding
     routes still inject only the main `sql`; `steps`/`queries` live execution is a later extension.

   Ties to milestone M7 ("schema → verified CRUD in ten minutes").

### B. Creation / scaffolding in the UI

3. **New route / file creation and CRUD scaffold from the explorer** — *done* (slices 1–3): Studio
   was single-file *edit* only; it now also **creates**. "Scaffold CRUD from table" (preview + apply)
   and "new route" both ship, wired to the v3 schema introspection. The hot-reload limit stands:
   newly created routes need a restart to be served, surfaced in the UI.
   - **Scaffold CRUD — preview** — *done* (slice 1): a **scaffold** page (linked from the explorer
     chrome when enabled) lists the dev datasource's tables introspected live (`CatalogIntrospector`)
     and previews the CRUD slice the generator would produce for a chosen table, reusing the CLI's
     `TableIntrospector` + `CrudScaffolder` so the output is byte-identical. Each generated file is
     shown highlighted with the apply disposition (`new`/`unchanged`/`regenerate`/`conflict`); the
     slice writes nothing. Database-free `StudioService.scaffoldPreview` (generation + conflict
     status); runtime `StudioScaffoldService` owns the introspection. Gated on writable Studio +
     `tesseraql.studio.scaffold.enabled`. `studio.scaffold.tables`/`studio.scaffold.preview`
     providers, `GET /scaffold/tables` + `POST /scaffold/preview` endpoints, `/ui/scaffold` page.
   - **Scaffold CRUD — apply** — *done* (slice 2): **Create these files** writes the previewed slice
     into the app home via `ScaffoldWriter`, honoring the checksum/edit-detection contract — a
     pristine generated file is regenerated, a file the user edited or owns is skipped and reported
     unless `force` overrides it. The result lists written/unchanged/skipped files (written ones link
     to the source editor) and flags newly written routes the manifest did not declare, which need a
     restart to be served (the hot reloader only swaps existing routes). Database-free
     `StudioService.scaffoldApply`; `studio.scaffold.apply` provider; `POST /scaffold/apply` endpoint.
   - **New blank route** — *done* (slice 3): a **New route** form on the explorer (when writable)
     takes a `web/**/<method>.yml` path and a recipe (`query-json`/`query-html`/`command-json`) and
     saves a parseable starter skeleton as a draft, then opens it in the source editor to finish — so
     creation reuses the existing validate → apply flow. Database-free `StudioService.newRouteDraft`;
     the `studio.newRoute` provider and the `/_tesseraql/studio/ui/new` route.

### C. Explorer / navigation polish

4. **Explorer tree + filter** — *done*: the flat route/job tables became a single directory tree
   folded from the source paths (folders as nested disclosures, each route/job a leaf linking to its
   source), with a live **filter** box (case-insensitive over id/path/recipe/method/source) that
   prunes the tree, re-rendered server-side via htmx (`hx-get` + `hx-select`, no bespoke JS).
   Database-free `StudioService.explorer(query)`; the tree is built in `StudioViews`; the
   `studio.explorer` provider and `GET /explorer?q=…` endpoint take the query.

### D. Editing safety / operations

5. **Draft robustness** — discard exists (#106).
   - **Concurrent-edit conflict detection** — *done*: a draft records the source it is based on, and
     apply refuses to overwrite a source that changed underneath it (no last-apply-wins) — the editor
     shows a conflict warning + a review-gated overwrite confirmation, and the apply endpoint answers
     `409` unless `force` is set. `StudioService.draftConflicts` / `applyDraft(path, force)`.
   - **Draft overview** — *done*: a **drafts** page (linked from the explorer when writable) lists
     every pending draft under `work/studio/drafts` with a link to its editor, a new/edit kind, and a
     conflict badge, plus a count of conflicting drafts. Database-free `StudioService.drafts()`; the
     `studio.drafts` provider and `GET /drafts` endpoint.
   - **Confirm-diff-before-apply** — partially met (the conflict case forces a review); a general
     "review the diff before every apply" gate is still open.
6. **Granular read-only + audit** — *done* (production hardening): per-role edit permission plus an
   audit trail.
   - **Audit trail** — *done*: every source-writing action (apply a draft, apply a scaffold) is
     stamped to an append-only `work/studio/audit/audit.jsonl` log with who/what/target/when, recorded
     at the single point each write happens so no caller path bypasses it. An **audit** page (linked
     from the explorer when writable) lists it newest-first. `StudioService.applyDraft(path, force,
     actor)` / `scaffoldApply(table, force, actor)` + `auditEntries(limit)`; `GET /audit`.
   - **Per-role edit permission** — *done*: an optional `tesseraql.studio.editRoles` allow-list
     refines the all-or-nothing `readOnly` — when set (and writable), only a caller holding one of
     those roles may mutate; every mutating endpoint/UI action answers `403` for everyone else and the
     explorer/source pages render the read-only view. The decision is per-caller from `principal.roles`
     (runtime `StudioAccess` gate); `StudioService` keeps enforcing the master switch. `STUDIO-4031 →
     403`.

### E. Editor live highlighting — **done (hc #264 shipped in 0.1.5)**

7. Live highlighting of the editable textarea (hc #264) — *done*.
   - **Built-in grammars** — *done* (slice 1): the editable `hc-code` source and sample fields opt
     into `installCodeEditor`'s `data-lang` overlay, grammar chosen by file type
     (`sql`/`yaml`/`html`/`json`); hc bumped 0.1.4 → 0.1.5. `StudioViews.editorLang`; `data-lang` on
     the editor divs.
   - **2-way SQL tokenizer + richer tokens** — *done* (slice 2): the server YAML/template highlighters
     adopt hc 0.1.5's `property` (YAML keys) / `tag` (elements) / `attribute` (plain attrs) tokens —
     directives stay `meta` — so the read-only/diff views match the live overlay's built-in grammars;
     and a `tql-sql` grammar registered via `registerCodeLanguage` in `tesseraql.js` (mirroring the
     server `SqlHighlighter`) gives the editable SQL field live highlighting with 2-way directives as
     `meta`. Editable `.sql` uses `data-lang="tql-sql"`. **E is now fully done.**

### F. Docs portal

8. **Export / share** — OpenAPI/JSON export, printable docs (reuse the PDF codec),
   per-route shareable links (docs are in-app/bearer-only today).
   - **API-spec export** — *done* (slice 1): an **Export** page (linked from the docs chrome) serves
     the app's OpenAPI 3 document and its htmx interaction contract as downloadable JSON, generated
     live from the manifest by the canonical `OpenApiGenerator` / `HtmxContractGenerator` (byte-identical
     to the build's `openapi.json` / `htmx-contract.json`). The download endpoints stream the spec as a
     `Content-Disposition` attachment via the standard `response.file` recipe, bearer-gated like the rest
     of the portal. `DocService.openApiJson`/`htmxContractJson`; `DocViews.export`; `docs.export`/
     `docs.openapi`/`docs.htmx` providers; `/ui/docs/export` (+ `/openapi`, `/htmx`) routes.
   - **Printable docs (PDF)** — *done* (slice 2): the Export page renders the app's route catalog
     (id, method, path, recipe, covering tests) to a PDF table through the canonical PDF codec (the
     `FileCodecs.discover()` path the export routes use, via its built-in grid — no template), shown
     in a preview frame with a `routes.pdf` download link. Studio stays free of the optional
     `tesseraql-pdf` stack: the runtime renders the PDF, degrading to a clear note when the module is
     absent. `DocService.routeCatalog`; `DocViews.routesPdf`; `docs.routesPdf` provider; the
     `/ui/docs/export/pdf` route. (Rich per-page PDF — arbitrary doc-page HTML→PDF — would need
     exposing the raw PDF engine past the row-oriented codec; a later extension.)
   - **Per-route shareable links** — *done* (slice 3, completing F8): docs are bearer-only by
     default; when the operator sets a signing secret (`tesseraql.docs.share.secret`, optional
     `tesseraql.docs.share.ttl`, default 7d), a route page offers a **Share** card with a signed,
     expiring link that opens that one route's **read-only contract** (method/path/recipe, inputs,
     security summary, validations, notifications, response) **without signing in**. The token is an
     HMAC-SHA256 over the route id + expiry (can't be retargeted or extended); the public
     `auth: public` share route verifies it (constant-time) and the expiry, else shows an
     invalid/expired notice. The public view omits SQL/tests/coverage; the secret is dedicated (not
     the JWT key). Off until the secret is set. Runtime `ShareLinks`; `DocViews.share`; `docs.share`
     provider; `/_tesseraql/docs/share/route` route.
9. **Coverage trend depth** — relax the "last 20 runs" cap for longer-term trends.

### G. Studio copilot — **gated (roadmap decision point 4)**

10. An MCP-driven "describe → draft → preview → apply" assist. Decision point 4 gates
    deeper Studio-copilot features on the MCP loop proving its worth; the Phase 24 MCP
    write tools (draft/apply through Studio) already exist.

## Recommended next

**A1 (rendered preview, incl. live data) is done**, and **A2 is fully done** — Run tests covers
every declarative case kind (`sql` read/write, `validate`, `contract`, `notify`, `http-call`) for
routes and jobs, sandboxed with auto-rollback. **B3 (scaffold-from-explorer) is fully done**:
preview (slice 1), apply (slice 2), and new blank route (slice 3) all shipped — pick a table, preview
its CRUD slice, and create the files (edit detection + force), or create a single starter route, each
with a restart notice for new routes. **C4 (explorer tree + filter) is done** — the explorer is a
filterable directory tree. **D5 (draft robustness) is done**: concurrent-edit
conflict detection and the draft overview shipped. **D6 (granular read-only + audit) is done**: the
audit trail and per-role edit permission both shipped. **A1 is now fully complete** — both follow-ups
(JSON output-field masking and PDF export preview) shipped. With A1, A2, B3, C4, D5, and D6 all done,
the remaining backlog is the docs-portal **F8/F9** items (OpenAPI/printable export, coverage-trend
depth), E (editor live highlighting, blocked on hc #264), and G (Studio copilot, gated). Recommended
next: **F8 docs export** (OpenAPI/JSON export, printable docs reusing the PDF codec, per-route
shareable links). **E is done** (hc 0.1.5 shipped #264): live highlighting of the
editable field (built-in grammars + a `tql-sql` 2-way grammar) and the richer read-only tokens both
shipped. With A1, A2, B3, C4, D5, D6, and E complete, the remaining backlog is the docs-portal F8/F9
items and G (Studio copilot, gated). G is gated.
